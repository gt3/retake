Retake
=========================

Pragmatic data structure and algorithmic transformations for modern Javascript apps.

Primary goal of Retake is to shift complexity from code to data. This implementation covers 3 important facets:
  1. List
    Persistent collection to store data linearly using head/tail decomposition.
  2. Transforms
  3. Traversal
